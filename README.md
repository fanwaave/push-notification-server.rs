# push-notification-server.rs

Dedicated Rust notification delivery service for Firebase Cloud Messaging HTTP v1, Apple Push Notification service, Expo Push, browser Web Push/VAPID, and optional SendGrid email and Twilio SMS fallback lanes.

Canonical repository: `github.com/fanwaave/push-notification-server.rs`.

This repository is moving from the `ORESoftware` account to the `fanwaave` organization. Preserve GitHub's transfer redirect and do not create a replacement repository at the legacy path.

> Google Play and Apple App Store distribute and sign applications; they do not deliver notifications. Android push is delivered through FCM, Apple push through APNs, and Expo-managed push through Expo's service backed by the configured FCM/APNs credentials.

Push remains the primary, isolated contract. The service uses a versioned provider-neutral `PushJob`/`PushOutcome` contract, target fingerprinting, bounded errors, strict validation, permanent CI/security checks, and a non-root container. Email and SMS use a separate `ContactJob`/`ContactOutcome` contract so adding fallback channels cannot weaken push-target validation or allow producer-controlled provider credentials and sender identities. Supabase/Postgres may store installation registrations and transactional outbox jobs, but it is not a delivery provider.

Push provider adapters:

- FCM HTTP v1 with service-account OAuth and token caching
- APNs with ES256 provider tokens and strict production/sandbox isolation
- Expo Push with batched tickets and receipt follow-up
- Web Push with direct RFC 8291 ECE encryption, ES256 VAPID, redirect blocking, strict host/address policy, and endpoint redaction

Optional contact adapters:

- SendGrid Mail Send with verified server-side sender identity, global/EU API selection, explicit-content and dynamic-template modes, sandbox support, bounded error classification, and recipient redaction
- Twilio Messages with Auth Token or API Key authentication, Messaging Service or E.164 sender selection, optional status callback and validity period, bounded error-code classification, and phone-number redaction

Ingestion interfaces:

- fail-closed authenticated HTTP v1 single and batch routes
- optional durable NATS JetStream WorkQueue ingestion for push jobs with dedicated result/dead-letter subjects
- shared validation, redacted outcomes, trace context, and retry classification

## Run

```bash
cargo run
```

Defaults:

```text
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=8121
RUST_LOG=push_notification_server=info,tower_http=info
```

Current HTTP endpoints:

- `GET /healthz`
- `GET /readyz`
- `POST /v1/push/jobs`
- `POST /v1/push/jobs/batch`
- `GET /v1/contact/readyz`
- `POST /v1/contact/jobs`
- `POST /v1/contact/jobs/batch`

JetStream remains disabled unless `NATS_URL` is configured. The initial contact lanes are HTTP-only; durable email/SMS subjects and signed delivery-status webhook ingestion are tracked separately so their semantics cannot be confused with push acceptance.

## Configuration

Provider credentials and sender identities are server-side configuration. Use Kubernetes External Secrets, workload identity, or another managed secret boundary. Never commit service-account JSON, private keys, API keys, Auth Tokens, device tokens, recipient addresses, phone numbers, Web Push endpoints, or subscription key material.

A successful SendGrid or Twilio API response means the provider accepted the request; it does not prove final delivery. Final email/SMS delivery state must come from signature-verified provider event/status callbacks and be persisted separately from the immediate `ContactOutcome`.

Examples are documented in `.env.example`. Detailed protocol and operations documents:

## JetStream reliability

The durable push consumer:

- uses dedicated versioned job, result, and dead-letter streams/subjects
- publishes a redacted result before Ack
- sends ack-progress heartbeats during long provider calls
- delayed-NAKs retryable outcomes while attempts remain
- dead-letters and Terms final retryable or poison messages
- hashes raw payloads instead of copying capability-bearing targets into DLQ records
- bounds concurrency and message size
- relies on NATS account/subject ACLs, with optional migration envelope authentication

## Web Push security

The Web Push adapter:

- uses Mozilla ECE directly for `aes128gcm` encryption
- signs VAPID with ES256 using a P-256 private key
- contains no unused RSA signing dependency path
- defaults to known browser push-service hosts
- requires HTTPS port 443 without embedded credentials or fragments
- disables redirects
- blocks private, loopback, link-local, CGNAT, documentation, benchmarking, reserved, multicast, unique-local, site-local, and mapped internal addresses
- supports a weaker explicit any-public-host mode with preflight DNS validation and documented rebinding limitations
- redacts endpoint paths, query strings, and subscription key material

## Validation

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --locked --all-features
```

GitHub Actions additionally validates process-level HTTP, live NATS compatibility, the Rust 1.88 container, cargo-deny policy, RustSec advisories, and full Git history with Gitleaks.

DEN-324 established the push contracts and safety boundary. DEN-325 through DEN-328 implement the four push adapters. DEN-329 adds authenticated HTTP and durable push NATS ingestion. DEN-331 established the first fully green integration-tested source SHA. DEN-1211 owns the end-to-end interoperability documentation. SendGrid/Twilio hardening is tracked under the production conformance and migration program without reopening the old mixed-service push implementation.
